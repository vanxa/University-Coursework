university-courseworks
======================

These are some of the courseworks during my studies at Edinburgh University. The following directories are included within the repository:
1. PPLS contains the second coursework on the "Parallel Programming Languages and Processing" course. The coursework is divided into 2 parts: an C/MPI program and a short report
2. Kelvin contains the work on the "System Level Integration Practical" course
3. SDP contains my part of the "System Design Project" course, which consists of the robot visual system. 
4. TTS contains the assignments for the "Text technologies" course.
5. EXC contains both assignments of the "Extreme Computing" course. The first assignment is a report on process migration, the second assignment involves implementing Hadoop jobs.


Currently, the PPLS and EXC directories are uploaded: the rest will be uploaded soon!
